# Generative AI Workshop

This is a React + TypeScript project built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - a fast build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. This workshop explores generative AI concepts and implementations using modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 20.19+, 22.12+ (required by Vite)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or pnpm/yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rnut/generative-ai-workshop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd generative-ai-workshop
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run serve
```
Locally preview the production build. Do not use this as a production server as it's not designed for that purpose.

> **Note**: The preview command will start a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at `http://localhost:4173`.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling with extremely fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

### What is Vite?

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced `/vit/`, like "veet") provides:
- ⚡️ Lightning fast development server with native ES modules
- 🔥 Instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Optimized build with Rollup
- 🎯 Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS and more

## 🌐 Try Online

You can try this project online without any local setup at [StackBlitz](https://vite.new/react-ts) - it runs the Vite-based build setup directly in the browser.
